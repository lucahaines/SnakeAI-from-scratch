# SnakeAI-from-scratch

Code of a genetic algorithm that modifies neural networks and learns to play snake

Each neural network contains two hidden layers whose sizes can be modified by the user
in Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. User can train a neural network and watch it play in
Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. To play snake manually, the user can use 
the play_manually() function in snake.py.
