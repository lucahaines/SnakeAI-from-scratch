# SnakeAI-from-scratch

Code of a genetic algorithm that modifies neural networks and learns to play the classic 
game 'Snake'.

Each neural network contains two hidden layers whose sizes can be modified by the user
in Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. User can train a neural network and watch it play in
Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. Also, the user can test out my current best snake 'Pea' 
play by running visualize_ai_performance("pea.pkl") in Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. 
Pea has a weird strategy but he often gets quite far. Make sure the neural network topology 
is 24 neurons in the first hidden layer (hiddensize1 = 24) and 12 neurons in the second hidden
layer (hiddensize2 = 12). To play snake manually, the user can run play_manually() in 
snake.py.
