# SnakeAI-from-scratch

Code of a genetic algorithm that modifies neural networks and learns to play snake

Each neural network contains two hidden layers whose sizes can be modified by the user
in Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. User can train a neural network and watch it play in
Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. Also, the user can test out my current best snake booger play
by running visualize_ai_performance("booger.pkl") in Snake_ai_Genetic_neural_network.py. Booger
has a weird strategy but he often gets quite far. Make sure the neural network topology is
24 neurons in the first hidden layer (hiddensize1 = 24) and 12 neurons in the second layer
(hiddensize2 = 12). To play snake manually, the user can use the play_manually() function in 
snake.py.
